# School of the Ancients — Research

</div>

> A living knowledge base for building an AI-mentored, VR-native school that blends ancient wisdom with modern tools.

## Executive snapshot

### Vision (in one paragraph)
SotA is an **AI-mentored, VR-native classroom** where learners debate, build, and reflect with historically grounded mentors. Instead of memorizing facts, students practice **judgment, reasoning, creativity, and epistemic rigor** through Socratic dialogue, adaptive quests, simulation-based scenarios, and portfolio work—**ancient methods supercharged by modern AI/VR**.

### One-page project overview (TL;DR from the VR brief)
- **idea:** *The Matrix* meets *Ready Player One* meets *Cosmos*: AI-driven NPCs + VR classrooms + an Operator/Loader to spawn themed worlds and vr prefabs on demand.

## Pedagogical foundations (research digest)

> Ancient schools didn’t just transmit facts—they formed **thinkers**. SotA ports those patterns into an AI era.

- **Greek (Academy/Lyceum):** dialectic, open inquiry, empirical habit—implemented as **AI Socratic tutors**, seminars, and labs.  
- **Stoic Rome:** character apprenticeship, reflective journaling—implemented as **virtue challenges** + guided reflections in VR.  
- **Egypt:** knowledge stewardship, moral maxims, learning-through-play—implemented as **stable core literacies** + playful drills for early learners.  
- **Confucian China:** canonical mastery, meritocratic exams—reframed as **concept mastery & oral vivas** (less rote, more reasoning).  
- **Vedic/Gurukul:** holistic mentorship, *samvāda* (dialogue), learn-by-doing—implemented as **adaptive quests**, residential-style cohorts, **hands-on** sims.  
- **Islamic Golden Age:** integrated revelation/reason, commentary/debate, *ijazah*—implemented as **interdisciplinary tracks**, **debate formats**, **micro-credentials**.

## Product system at a glance

### Core modules
- **Mentor Engine (NPCs):** Historical-style agents with persona prompts, dialogue memory, and “withhold-answer” Socratic scaffolds.  
- **Operator / Loader:** Voice/text orchestration to **spawn worlds, assets, and scenes** (“Operator, load the Renaissance”).  
- **Quest Builder:** Converts a learner goal into a multi-step path (brief → probes → activities → reflection → assessment).  
- **Assessment Suite:**  
  - **Oral vivas** (adaptive Q&A)  
  - **Scenario sims** in VR (ethics, policy, lab skills)

## From research to features (mapping table)

| Ancient pattern | SotA feature |
|---|---|
| Socratic dialectic | **AI-Socratic tutors** with probing follow-ups & hinting trees |
| Apprenticeship & virtue practice | **Weekly virtue quests** + reflective journaling UX |
| Stable core curricula | **Core literacies** (logic, rhetoric, quant, epistemic hygiene) with spaced practice |
| Canon mastery → merit | **Concept mastery checks** + **oral vivas** vs rote regurgitation |
| Learn by doing / play | **VR labs & microworlds**, mini-games that teach skills |
| Commentary & debate | **Debate rooms** with stance prompts, time-boxed rebuttals |
| Ijazah / license | **Micro-credentials** (mentor-signed) per text/track |
| Interdisciplinary synthesis | **Cross-track quests** (e.g., “Design a just city” across Plato/Confucius/urban data) |

## Roadmap (condensed from the VR brief)

1. **Week 1** — Unity project setup, repos, hosting.  
2. **Week 2** — Prototype color-room scenes to prove dynamic loading.  
3. **Week 3** — First AI mentor (e.g., Leonardo) in VR.  
4. **Week 4** — Socratic scaffolding & knowledge checks.  
5. **Week 5** — **Operator/Loader** voice control for scenes/assets.  
6. **Week 6** — Mentor set expansion (Galileo, Cleopatra, Marcus, Aristotle, Socrates).  
7. **Week 7** — User tests; iterate flow, immersion, prompts.  
8. **Week 8** — Performance polish; multi-mentor classroom demo.

**PR checklist**  
- Evidence-based (cite which principle you used and why).  
- Accessibility & safety considered (motion, reading level, moderation).  
- Clear evaluation rubric (what “good” looks like).  
- Modular & reusable (prompt blocks, assets, rubrics).

## Design notes for implementers

- **Withhold answers early.** Prefer questions, counter-examples, and hints. (Socratic.)  
- **Assess process, not just outputs.** Reward verification, source critique, and revision. (Epistemic rigor.)  
- **Teach with stories.** Frame quests in narrative arcs and exemplars. (Maxims, parables.)  
- **Make it embodied.** Use VR actions to encode ideas (build, sort, configure, test). (Apprenticeship.)  
- **Balance core + choice.** Keep shared literacies stable, let electives go deep. (Canon + curiosity.)

---

## Sample artifacts to include (suggested)

- **Persona prompt packs** (Socrates, Ada, Cleopatra, etc.) with do/don’t behaviors.  
- **Socratic tree templates** (topic → probes → misconceptions → remedial activities).  
- **VR scenario scripts** (roles, win/lose conditions, debrief prompts, rubrics).  
- **Assessment rubrics** (viva, portfolio, debate, lab).  
- **Operator intents** (spawn_skybox, spawn_asset, layout, attach_behavior…).  
- **Micro-credential spec** (criteria, evidence, mentor sign-off).

## FAQs

**Q: Isn’t this just chat with a historical skin?**  
**A:** No. The core loop is **question → action → reflection → evidence**, not answer regurgitation. Dialogue gates activity; VR makes it embodied; assessment values reasoning and craft.

**Q: Why VR at all?**  
**A:** To restore apprenticeship and “learning by doing”—assembly, observation, experiment, performance—at scale.

**Q: What about memorization?**  
**A:** We reserve it for *core literacies* (e.g., mental math, logic fallacies, key texts)—the rest is **on-demand** and **applied**.
